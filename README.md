The main notebook for this project is EG2140_Code.ipynb, which includes all necessary code for forecasting and evaluation.
This project utilizes data from the Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition hosted by IEEE. The goal is to forecast energy production using various machine learning models.
Data is downloaded from IEEE Dataport https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/hybrid-energy-forecasting-and-trading-competition
The required data files are: 
Demand data: dwd_icon_eu_demand_20200920_20231027.nc
Wind data: dwd_icon_eu_hornsea_1_20200920_20231027.nc
Solar data: dwd_icon_eu_pes10_20200920_20231027.nc
Energy data: Energy_Data_20200920_20231027.csv
Required packages are listed in requirements.txt
To run the code, open the EG2140_Code.ipynb notebook and execute all cells. The code is designed to take approximately one hour to run, depending on the computational resources available.
